# kobo-utilities
This is a copy of @davidfor's kobo utilities calibre plugin.

The intent is that people grab the code, modify it as desired, post a beta on MobileRead,
then eventually propose that the beta be released. I keep this repository up-to-date with
releases, easy to do because I have been the mod that moves betas to the first page.

I am not willing to curate/apply pull requests but I am happy to add new releases to the
repository.
